# PJ1301 Toolset

This is a PWA app and as such can be downloaded to any computer after visiting the website (hosted at [https://pj1301-toolbox.netlify.app/](https://pj1301-toolbox.netlify.app/)).

&nbsp;

## Run

To run locally, run:

```bash
npm start
```

&nbsp;

## Build

To build a stable downloadable program, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

To check the deployed version, it is not necessary to upload to Netlify, simply build the project as above and then serve it locally:

```bash
# Assuming that serve was pre-installed with npm i -g serve
serve -s build
```

This can even be downloaded from the browser in this state.
